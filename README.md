🌟 **Welcome to my GitHub!** I specialize in developing robust solutions for Salesforce, focusing on Apex frameworks, integrations, and Lightning Web Components (LWCs).  

💻 I enjoy my work and am always eager to grow my skills and knowledge. One of the things I love most is tackling **challenging and interesting tasks** — they allow me to bring my ideas to life, including through open-source projects.

🤝 I also enjoy meeting new people and exploring new opportunities. I’m confident that we’d have a great time connecting, and I look forward to what we could achieve together! 🚀✨
