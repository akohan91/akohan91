Welcome to my GitHub! I specialize in developing robust solutions for Salesforce, focusing on Apex frameworks, integrations, and Lightning Web Components (LWCs).  

I enjoy my work and am always eager to grow my skills and knowledge. One of the things I love most is tackling challenging and interesting tasks — they allow me to bring my ideas to life, including through open-source projects.

I also enjoy meeting new people and exploring new opportunities. I’m confident that we’d have a great time connecting, and I look forward to what we could achieve together!
